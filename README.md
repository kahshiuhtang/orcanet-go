# Peer Node

## Basic Functionality

* Retrieving
    1) Find addresses corresponding with a specific file hash inside the DHT
    2) Connect through HTTP with the cheapest option
    3) Recieve chunks from the HTTP server
        1) If the file is small (< 4KB), the entire transaction is done in one go
        2) Otherwise, files are sent in chunks
            1) A signed transaction must be sent to the sender
    4) Close connection
    5) Add file to imported folder inside files directory

* Storing
    1) Hash the file content that you are trying to store
    2) Send a request to store the file in to the DHT
    3) Make sure file is inside the stored folder inside files directory
    4) Accept/Decline any requests for said file, or set the default behavior
    5) Send all microtransactions to blockchain once everything is done


## Assumptions

1) Each consumer/producer has their own IP address

2) Producer sets up local HTTP server

3) Consumer can fetch document from producer's local HTTP server


## Running

First generate the gRPC files for GO. Make sure you are in the root of the project and run the command below.

``` bash

$ protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
    internal/fileshare/file_share.proto 
```

GO Version: 1.21.4

```bash

$ make all

```

## CLI interface

Requesting a file:

```bash
$ get [ip] [port] [filename]
```

Storing a file:

```bash
$ store [ip] [address] [filename]
```

Putting a key inside DHT

```bash

$ putKey [key] [value]

```

Getting a key inside DHT

```bash

$ getKey [key]

```

Import a file:

```bash
$ import [filepath]
```

Complete pipeline for getting a file from DHT:

```bash

$ fileGet [fileHash] 

```

Send a certain amount of coin to an address

```bash

$ send [amount] [ip] 

```

Hash a file

```bash

$ hash [filename]

```

Listing all files stored for IPFS

```bash
$ list
```

Getting current peer node location

```bash
$ location
```

Testing network speeds

```bash
$ network
```

Exiting Program

```bash
$ exit
```

#### File System:

* There is a folder called <i>files</i>. This is where all the files that are available to the user is stored

* Any file directly stored inside <i>files</i> folder is considered <i>uploaded</i> to the client.

* Any file that has been requested by the user is stored in the <i>files/requested</i> folder.

* Any file that is available to be requested for by anyone on the network is in <i>files/stored</i>.

* Technically, you can import the files manually if you drag them inside the desired folder. There is currently no protection against this.

* The <i>transactions</i> folder stores all of the transactions that have been processed and stored.

#### Notes:

* Files that are on the network should be in the files folder. This can be done manually or by using the CLI

* Inside the config file, set your public key and private key location. If you don't want to, the CLI will generate a key-pair for you.

* Only .txt, .json and .mp4 file formats are currently supported.


## HTTP Functionality

Here is all of the routes available on the HTTP server that is started when the peer-node loads. Most routes should return 400 if an issue with the parameters sent by the client did not work, 405 if the wrong method type (GET, POST) was used, 500 if there was an error creating, searching or opening files and 200 if everything is successful. If a response is sent inside of an array, that indicates that at minimum, 0 json objects could be sent but more than 1 json object could also be inside of that json array. If not explicitly stated, the Response Body should be a json object with a single field name "status", explaing the current status of the request. Furthermore, when any response code other than 200 is sent, there should be this same json object sent inside the Response Body.

1. Route /getFile is a POST route. This will send back the data from any file that is found LOCALLY. It will first look in the files folder, then files/requested and finally files/stored. You can send either a filename or a filehash.

Request Body:
```json
{
    "filename": "string",
    "cid": "string"
}
```

---

2. Route /requestRemoteFile is a POST route. This will request a file from the network via a hash and send the file back to the user. The file, if found, will be stored in files/requested folder.

Request Body:
```json
{
    "cid": "string"
}
```

---

3. Route /uploadFile is a POST route. This will move a local file, from anywhere on the computer, into the <i>files</i> directory. You should give the absolute path, or a path that is relative to the root directory of the peer node folder.

Request Body:
```json
{
    "filepath": "string"
}
```

---

4. Route /deleteFile is a POST route. This will delete a file that is stored from within the files folder
